# Motor Definition File: 2019_Definition_Draft

# Amount of white space between each value is not important, there just needs to be some
# Thrust curve will be linearly interpolated between the given values
# Time(s) should be relative to motor ignition      #2,2.5,3,3

# Unburned fuel/oxidizer not currently accounted for, could be added in as a fixed mass?
# Engine/Tank structure mass should be accounted for separately - the motor only accounts for propellant masses
# MOI = Moment of Inertia
    # It is assumed that oxidizer and fuel MOIs are always defined about the current CG of the oxidizer and fuel, respectively
# To represent a solid rocket motor, simply put all of the MOI/CG/Flowrate info in either the fuel or oxidizer columns and set the other one to zero

# Meters, all Z-coordinate, assumed centered
